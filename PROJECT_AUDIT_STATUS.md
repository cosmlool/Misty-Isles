# Misty Isles — Project Audit Status

Updated: 2026-11-09 (continued audit checkpoint)

## Purpose and handoff rule

This file is the durable checkpoint for the ongoing full-game audit. On every chat transition, read this file first, then verify the referenced GitHub branch/PR and current commit before continuing. Do not repeat completed checks unless the code changed, a test failed, or the previous evidence was incomplete.

Do not merge to `main`, change gameplay rules, or alter real player data without explicit user approval.

## Repository and active work

Repository: https://github.com/cosmlool/Misty-Isles

Known Stage 29 branches:
- `stage29/playwright-eyes-foundation` — current audit/browser-QA working branch; PR #14 is open and marked Draft.
- `stage29/pvp-rules-implementation` — separate PvP branch. Its `server/src/pvpOperations.ts` currently matches the foundation branch (blob SHA `efb35a686c6a74d20d4997909606c62df2e5640b`).

PR #14: https://github.com/cosmlool/Misty-Isles/pull/14
- Goal: full audit of server operations, persistence, economy, inventory, crafting, auction, clans, PvP, expeditions/dungeons, auth, and UI.
- PR description says a previous CI run had 72/73 server tests pass; the failing expedition test was corrected to wait for the normal `expeditionState` message and persisted file.
- Full CI for the latest PR head is still NOT CONFIRMED. Do not call it green.
- PR remains Draft; `main` must not be changed without approval.

Latest relevant commit discovered in repository history: `770f7361827d92743c49dc8621955e07379b8d76` — adds process-crash recovery coverage for clan WAL transactions. This is a verified commit, but the connector did not expose the exact current branch HEAD SHA; re-resolve branch HEAD before making further code changes.

## Verified by source inspection (not a claim that tests were run locally)

### Browser QA
Branch: `stage29/playwright-eyes-foundation`
- `e2e` uses Playwright 1.56.1, Chromium/Chrome, ports 5173 and 2567.
- Browser checks cover guest login, all four races, character creation, starting inventory, reconnect persistence, expedition hunt and victory, shop purchase (130 gold), equipping, persistence after reload, 17 main tabs at 390px, admin screen render, and uncaught page errors.
- The test server uses a temporary data directory and synthetic accounts; the test-only 1-second expedition search timer changes only a copied `forgotten_lands.json`.
- The README has a numbering gap (11 to 13); documentation-only issue.
- Browser tests have NOT been confirmed as executed successfully in this audit session.

### Server test inventory
The branch `server/package.json` test script lists 29 test files:
`jsonPersistence`, `inventoryOperations`, `playerJson`, `playerSaves`, `auctionTransactions`, `clanTransactions`, `auctionOperations`, `craftingQueue`, `craftingRuntime`, `economyRuntime`, `clanWarOperations`, `clanWarRuntime`, `pvpOperations`, `pvpRuntime`, `guestActionsRuntime`, `duplicateSessionRuntime`, `dailyStreakRuntime`, `calendarOperations`, `prototypeKeysRuntime`, `expeditionSafetyRuntime`, `expeditionOperations`, `dungeonAttemptsRuntime`, `raceEquipmentRuntime`, `authLogoutRuntime`, `authAccountRuntime`, `groupTravelPersistenceRuntime`, `groupDungeonRuntime`, `questRewardsRuntime`, `clanBroadcastRuntime`.
These are present in the script; this is not proof all 29 pass.

### PvP — inspected implementation
Files:
- `server/src/pvpOperations.ts`
- `server/test/pvpOperations.test.ts`
- `server/test/pvpRuntime.test.ts`
- `server/src/index.ts` handlers `pvpList` / `pvpChallenge`

Observed rules:
- Attacker cooldown: 15 minutes.
- Victim immunity: 60 minutes.
- Winner steals 20% of the loser's current gold (floor).
- Offer contains up to four real saved characters.
- Current code also restricts level difference to ±2 and excludes characters with active immunity.
- Server validates that a real-player target is in the attacker's offered list.
- Runtime test seeds offline saved characters and checks four offered real opponents, 20% transfer, saved cooldown, victim immunity, and exclusion during immunity.
- Combat is still a combat-rating comparison; report fields `damage` and `received` are zero. This matches the old passport note; do not silently convert it to HP combat.
- Known bot IDs are still accepted directly by `pvpChallenge`, although `pvpList` currently builds its list from saved characters. Review whether this legacy training-bot path is intentional and whether it should remain accessible.
- User's previously confirmed design: PvP on a 15-minute cadence; the candidate pool may include all registered characters; show four opponents; player chooses one; 20% gold transfer. The current ±2-level restriction conflicts with the stated all-registered-characters pool and must be treated as a mismatch to correct, not as an approved design rule. Immunity exclusion remains a separate protection rule.

### Clans and clan wars
- `clanTransactions.ts` uses a write-ahead transaction journal for player, clan, war, and territory snapshots.
- Commit `770f736...` adds a process-crash test that exits after a partial target write, then verifies recovery from the journal.
- The transaction writes the journal atomically, then atomically replaces the four target JSON files sequentially; startup/next commit recovery replays the snapshot and removes the journal.
- Recovery fails closed and retains an unreadable journal rather than silently deleting it.
- Durability limitation: implementation uses write + rename but does not call `fsync` on the journal/target files or containing directory. Existing test proves a child-process termination between writes, not sudden power-loss durability. Decide whether process-crash recovery is the intended guarantee or whether stronger disk-flush guarantees are required.
- Snapshot validation checks top-level object/array structure and object-valued entries, not the full domain schema of every player/clan record; upstream persistence validation remains important.
- `clanWarRuntime.test.ts` covers donation, per-player attack cooldown, cumulative damage, score broadcast, expiration settlement, one-time reward, and disband cleanup.
- `clanWarOperations.ts` currently defines a 1-second clan-war attack cooldown. Verify whether this is intentionally test-build timing or an unintended live gameplay value before public release.
- Expired wars settle on a later request, not via an independent timer.

### Expeditions and dungeons
- Group travel persistence runtime test covers saving group travel start/claim for every member.
- Group boss-dungeon runtime test covers win rewards and loss costs for every participant.
- Solo dungeon runtime test covers remaining daily entries and the three-entry cap.
- Full group membership reconstruction after disconnect/restart remains unimplemented; orphaned active actions are safely reset. This remains open.

#### Additional dungeon source inspection (server/src/index.ts, lines 502–536)
- Group boss-dungeon entry requires the leader to start it, every member online, each member at the dungeon minimum level, and each member below the daily cap of three attempts.
- Attempt count and battle count increment for every participant before the win/loss branch; losses consume an attempt and give no rewards.
- Group success applies HP loss, healing/passives, XP, gold, activity records, boss/victory counters, combat history, and one persisted snapshot of all participating players. Base dungeon gold is divided with `Math.floor(dungeon.gold / groupSize)`; any remainder is not distributed.
- Group drops include one guaranteed resource and optional boss drops; each item is assigned randomly to one group member. Confirm whether this random per-item distribution is intended.
- Group failure applies health loss, records activity and combat reports, consumes attempts, and persists the group members together.
- Solo dungeon attempts increment before the outcome; wins award XP/gold/resources and random bonus materials/equipment; losses award no loot and still consume an attempt.
- The dungeon handler has no explicit request/idempotency key. The client includes `dungeonRun` in its `guardedActions` set and blocks a second click while the action is pending (with an 8-second fallback timeout). This reduces accidental double-clicks in the official UI, but the server itself still treats a second distinct message as another valid run and consumes another daily attempt. Confirm whether that is acceptable for direct/custom clients; no duplicate reward bug is proven.
- No definite dungeon exploit is confirmed from this source read alone. Runtime coverage still needs execution on the exact branch snapshot.

- Group travel persistence runtime test covers saving group travel start/claim for every member.
- Group boss-dungeon runtime test covers win rewards and loss costs for every participant.
- Solo dungeon runtime test covers remaining daily entries and the three-entry cap.
- Full group membership reconstruction after disconnect/restart remains unimplemented; orphaned active actions are safely reset. This remains open.
- Dungeon rewards, duplicate/replay requests, balance, and edge cases still require deeper audit.

### Public-launch blockers / design decisions
- Test admin handler remains openly callable in the inspected server source. Restore server-side authorization/allowlisting before public deployment.
- Full CI for current branch head remains unconfirmed.
- Full group restoration after disconnect/restart remains open.
- Dungeon reward/replay/balance/edge-case audit remains open.
- `statPoints` allocation design remains undecided.
- Clan-war auto-settlement timer remains a design/implementation follow-up.
- PvP ±2-level matching and direct bot challenge path require explicit review.

## Current audit progress

Status: ongoing; source review and test inventory inspection only. No local test suite was executed in this session.

Completed evidence collection in this checkpoint:
- [x] Confirmed known active Stage 29 branch names.
- [x] Read PR #14 current description/state (open, Draft).
- [x] Read browser QA README, Playwright config, and main smoke test.
- [x] Read branch server test script (29 test files listed).
- [x] Read PvP operations and runtime test assertions.
- [x] Read clan-war operation logic and runtime assertions.
- [x] Read clan transaction WAL implementation and process-crash recovery tests.
- [x] Read group travel, group dungeon, and solo dungeon test sources.
- [x] Inspected PvP/admin handlers in server source.
- [x] Inspected solo and group dungeon handlers, reward distribution, attempt accounting, and persistence paths.
- [x] Created and extended the audit checkpoint in the working branch. Checkpoint commits created in this session, newest last: `6fc4168c34cdd2789ce2959dcb3f2a37244bdefe`, `7842b91c98b98c5876b86dc39af1693bc4068511`, `2480fea86d7606817b231892a0cce275416126fb`. Re-resolve the branch tip on resume.
- [ ] Resolve exact current HEAD SHA for the separate PvP branch.
- [ ] Confirm full CI for the current PR head.
- [ ] Run full server tests and client/server builds locally from the same branch snapshot.
- [ ] Continue systematic handler-by-handler audit of all game systems.
- [x] Checked client pending-action guard for `dungeonRun`; official UI blocks repeated clicks while pending. Server-side request idempotency remains absent and should be considered separately.
- [ ] Finish dungeon reward/replay/edge-case audit, including whether random group loot distribution and lost remainder from divided group gold are intended.
- [ ] Correct the PvP candidate pool to honor the user's stated all-registered-characters requirement; review legacy bot direct-challenge path separately.
- [ ] Verify admin handler authorization before public release.
- [ ] Produce final audit report before gameplay changes.

## Next action

Resolve the current branch heads and CI first. Then continue the handler-by-handler audit from dungeon reward/replay flows and the remaining server handlers. Do not rerun already-passing local checks unless the tested commit changed or the result is missing.
